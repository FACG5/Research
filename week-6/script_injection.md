# Script injection

**Script injection** is security vulnerability, a serious security threat that enables an attacker to inject malicious code in the user interface elements of your Web form of data-driven Web sites.

Wikipedia states, HTML/Script injection is a popular subject, commonly termed Cross-Site Scripting , or XSS . XSS refers to an injection flaw whereby user input to a web script or something along such lines is placed into the output HTML, without being checked for HTML code or scripting.

Common Tags Prone to Script Injections

The following are some of the most common HTML tags that may be prone to script injection attacks:

Simulating Script Injection Attacks

In this section we ll write a sample application that demonstrates how script injection takes place.

### Follow these steps:
1. Create a new Web site and save it with a name
2. Switch to the design view mode of the Default.aspx file
3. Drag and drop a label, a textbox, and a button control onto the Web form (here s how the mark-up code of your .aspx file will look):
4. Next, set the Default.aspx Web form as the start page of the application

### The most popular ways of prevention xss:
XSS attack is a type of code injection: user input is mistakenly interpreted as malicious program code. In order to prevent this type of code injection, secure input handling is needed.


* **Encoding** which escapes the user input so that the browser interprets it only as data, not as code.
* **Validation** which filters the user input so that the browser interprets it as code without malicious commands.
