#  Continuous Integration


 ------------------------


# What is Continuous Integration

#### Is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control .



# Continuous Integration brings multiple benefits to your organization:

* #### Build a solid foundation .
* #### Spend less time debugging and more time adding features .
* #### Stop waiting to find out if your codeâ€™s going to work .
* #### Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly .

# How to do ?

### Developers check out code into their private workspaces When done, commit the changes to the repository
* #### The CI server monitors the repository and checks out changes when they occur .
* #### The CI server builds the system and runs unit and integration tests .
* #### The CI server releases deployable artifacts for testing .
* #### The CI server assigns a build label to the version of the code it just built .
* #### The CI server informs the team of the successful build .
* #### If the build or tests fail, the CI server alerts the team .
* #### The team fixes the issue at the earliest opportunity .
