# Continuous Integration (CI) 

#### Continuous Integration.
Is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control .

#### Continuous Integration brings multiple benefits to your organization:

* Spend less time debugging and more time adding features .
* Build a solid foundation .
* Stop waiting to find out if your codeâ€™s going to work .
* Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly .

#### As a developer , how can I do it :flushed: ?!

* Developers check out code into their private workspaces
When done, commit the changes to the repository.
* The CI server monitors the repository and checks out changes when they occur .
* The CI server builds the system and runs unit and integration tests .
* The CI server releases deployable artifacts for testing .
* The CI server assigns a build label to the version of the code it just built .
* The CI server informs the team of the successful build .
* If the build or tests fail, the CI server alerts the team .
* The team fixes the issue at the earliest opportunity .
* Continue to continually integrate and test throughout the project .


### The popular tool for CI is Travis :
