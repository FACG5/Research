#### Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

* Execute any code.
* Make changes to the request and the response objects.
* End the request-response cycle.
* Call the next middleware function in the stack.
* If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

##### An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

* Application-level middleware
* Router-level middleware
* Error-handling middleware
* Built-in middleware
* Third-party middleware

##### Application-level middleware
Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the __app.use()__ and __app.METHOD()__ functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.
```js
//This example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed every time the app receives a request
var app = express()
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})
```

```js
//This example shows a middleware function mounted on the /user/:id path. The function is executed for any type of HTTP request on the /user/:id path.
app.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})
```

```js
//This example shows a route and its handler function (middleware system). The function handles GET requests to the /user/:id path.
app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  res.send('USER')
})
```

```js
//Here is an example of loading a series of middleware functions at a mount point, with a mount path. It illustrates a middleware sub-stack that prints request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path.
app.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
  next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})
```

```js
/*Route handlers enable you to define multiple routes for a path. The example below defines two routes for GET requests to the /user/:id path. The second route will not cause any problems, but it will never get called because the first route ends the request-response cycle.

This example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path.*/
app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('ID:', req.params.id)
  next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  res.send('User Info')
})

// handler for the /user/:id path, which prints the user ID
app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  res.end(req.params.id)
})
```

```js
app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
  if (req.params.id === '0') next('route')
  // otherwise pass the control to the next middleware function in this stack
  else next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  // send a regular response
  res.send('regular')
})

// handler for the /user/:id path, which sends a special response
app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  res.send('special')
})
```
##### Router-level middleware

Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().

```
var router = express.Router()
 ```

Load router-level middleware by using the router.use() and router.METHOD() functions.

The following example code replicates the middleware system that is shown above for application-level middleware, by using router-level middleware:
```js
var app = express()
var router = express.Router()

// a middleware function with no mount path. This code is executed for every request to the router
router.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})

// a middleware sub-stack shows request info for any type of HTTP request to the /user/:id path
router.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
  next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})

// a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path
router.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next router
  if (req.params.id === '0') next('route')
  // otherwise pass control to the next middleware function in this stack
  else next()
}, function (req, res, next) {
  // render a regular page
  res.render('regular')
})

// handler for the /user/:id path, which renders a special page
router.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.params.id)
  res.render('special')
})

// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router)
```
##### Error-handling middleware
Define error-handling middleware functions in the same way as other middleware functions, except with four arguments instead of three, specifically with the signature (err, req, res, next)):
```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
```
##### Built-in middleware
* express.static serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.
* express.json parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. NOTE: Available with Express 4.16.0+
* express.urlencoded parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. NOTE: Available with Express 4.16.0+

##### Third-party middleware
Use third-party middleware to add functionality to Express apps.

Install the Node.js module for the required functionality, then load it in your app at the application level or at the router level.

* body-parser
* compression
* cookie-session
* cookie-parser
* serve-index
* session
* morgan

###### Cookie-parser
Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.
``` 
$ npm install cookie-parser
``` 
#### cookieParser(secret, options)
#### cookieParser.JSONCookie(str)
#### cookieParser.JSONCookies(cookies)
#### cookieParser.signedCookie(str, secret)
#### cookieParser.signedCookies(cookies, secret)

##### Example
```js
var express      = require('express')
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')
 
var app = express()
app.use(cookieParser())
 
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  console.log('Cookies: ', req.cookies)
})
 
app.listen(8080)
```
